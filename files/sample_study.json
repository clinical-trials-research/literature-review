            "briefSummary": "Permissive hypercapnia increased the survival rate in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who required mechanical ventilation in critical care medicine. This has been explained by its association with ventilator induced lung injury. Since then, a protective lung ventilation strategy has been very important, with a low tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg. Patients undergoing surgery will inevitably require mechanical ventilation. In particular, patients undergoing one lung ventilation for thoracic surgery may have increased airway pressure and a greater chance of ventilator induced lung injury. Recently, protective lung ventilation has been applied to patients undergoing one ung ventilation during thoracic surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in the degree of pulmonary oxygenation and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in hypercapnia induced by controlling the respiratory rate with a constant tidal volume."
