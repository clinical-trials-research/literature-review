    "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if kinesiotaping for edema management will decrease post-operative edema in patients with bilateral total knee arthroplasty. The leg receiving kinesiotaping during inpatient rehabilitation may have decreased edema and pain and improved movement and function when compared to the leg not receiving kinesiotape.",
    "DetailedDescription": "After being informed about the study and potential risk, all patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation after bilateral total knee arthroplasty will have Kinesio(R)Tape applied to one randomly selected leg while the other leg serves as a control. Measurement of bilateral leg circumference, knee range of motion, numerical rating scale for pain, and selected questions from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score will occur at regular intervals throughout the rehabilitation stay. Patients will receive standard rehabilitation.",
